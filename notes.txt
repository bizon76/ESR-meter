CLKRMD in PMD0 disabled (should it be?)

Resistance with inductor support
- Turn on current for a time (1ms is enough for 10mH)
- Measure with adc X times in succession (maybe 16 times) and avg. 
- Turn off current, don't turn on discharge mosfet, current should go down faster in reverse schottky diode.
  3ms should be enough for 10mH
- Turn on discharge mosfet for maybe 1ms in case someone connected a cap
- Maybe repeat this a few times and avg?
