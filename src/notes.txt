CLKRMD in PMD0 disabled (should it be?)

Resistance with inductor support
- Turn on current for a time (1ms is enough for 10mH)
- Measure with adc X times in succession (maybe 16 times) and avg. 
- Turn off current, don't turn on discharge mosfet, current should go down faster in reverse schottky diode.
  3ms should be enough for 10mH
- Turn on discharge mosfet for maybe 1ms in case someone connected a cap
- Maybe repeat this a few times and avg?


-- Timer1
The following gives timer value of 2
    __asm("MOVLB 0x4");
    __asm("BSF T1CON, 0x0");
    __asm("NOP");
    __asm("BCF T1CON, 0x0");

So to measure time of instructions between start and stop of timer, subtract 1 from timer

-- ACLR
The following takes equivalent time as 7 instructions
    ADCON2bits.ACLR = 1;
    while(ADCON2bits.ACLR){};

* The timer keeps running after overflow has occurred

* IMPORTANT:  ADACC-value is not stable while the ADC is running
