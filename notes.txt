CLKRMD in PMD0 disabled (should it be?)

Resistance with inductor support
- Turn on current for a time (1ms is enough for 10mH)
- Measure with adc X times in succession (maybe 16 times) and avg. 
- Turn off current, don't turn on discharge mosfet, current should go down faster in reverse schottky diode.
  3ms should be enough for 10mH
- Turn on discharge mosfet for maybe 1ms in case someone connected a cap
- Maybe repeat this a few times and avg?


-- Timer1
The following gives timer value of 2
    __asm("MOVLB 0x4");
    __asm("BSF T1CON, 0x0");
    __asm("NOP");
    __asm("BCF T1CON, 0x0");

So to measure time of instructions between start and stop of timer, subtract 1 from timer

-- ACLR
The following takes equivalent time as 7 instructions
    ADCON2bits.ACLR = 1;
    while(ADCON2bits.ACLR){};

* The timer keeps running after overflow has occurred


    while(true) 
    {
        for(int i=1; i <= 5; i++)
        {
        _nop();
        _nop();
        // 3c diff?
        // 1 -> 0x70
        // 2 -> 0xac
        // 3 -> 0xe8
        // 4 -> 0x124
        // 5 -> 0x160
        
        
        doubleBurstSample(_LATA_LATA1_MASK, i);
        setSevenSegPos(0, digitTo7Seg(i));
        __delay_ms(1000);
            
        }
    }

    // Maybe? Global aggregate func?
    
    //timer1ReloadVal
    uint16_t x = 0;
    __asm("MOVLB 0x4");
__asm("BSF T1CON, 0x0");
    while(true){

        TMR1H = 200;
        TMR1L = 0;
        

        while(!PIR4bits.TMR1IF){} // Wait for timer overflow
        PIR4bits.TMR1IF = 0;
        
        x++;
        displayHex(x);
   
   }
